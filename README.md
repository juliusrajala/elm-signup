# Elm Signup

Elm signup is an extremely simple stand-alone app for... Well, signing up for things, I guess.

Obviously needs some sort of a backend to actually store the submissions to you could use this for services or events, I suppose. Mostly built this out of interest in the language.

Need elm + npm for this stuff.

Greatly recommend installing create-elm-app for this. [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## After you have create-elm-app set up
```
elm-app start # Run development server
elm-app build # Build project as a static web-app
```
